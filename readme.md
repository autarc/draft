draft.js
========

Draft is JavaScript framework to ease the creation of rapid prototypes for multiplayer games.

Create client & server interaction without bothering much about configuration :)

It abstracts common tasks like input, asset handling and events - allowing you to concentrate on the game logic itself.

The common game cycle will be used:

- init

- input
- update
- render


** The project is WIP **
========================

Following features should be supported:

- states (coupling of settings in the environment)

- events / FRP, support of logic objects

- panel/layer manager to distingiush between depth level

- using the prototype chain for dynamic inheritance
